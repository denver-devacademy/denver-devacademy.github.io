      <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
      <!-- What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? -->
      <!-- What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind? -->
      <p>My long term goal is to become a public speaker and educator who makes cool stuff and inspires people to make cool useful stuff for other people. I think we need more humane tech that helps people support their health and treats users more like humans rather than customers or just entries in a database</p>
      <!-- What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? -->
      <p>I believe my biggest strengths will be creative thinking (in an initially somewhat more restricted capacity than pre-COVID Denver, but those barriers will slowly break down as I re-expose myself to once familiar challenges)</p>
      <!-- Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp? -->
      <p>I'm a bit better at dealing with overstimulation since my previous learning plan regarding foundations, however I think a lot of my other challenges and strengths remain - although almost all have been reduced to a certain capacity as I've shifted my focus to trying to overcome them and seeing them in a light that is more, I suppose, "growth-mindset-y", not too sure how to phrase that but I think it makes sense.</p>
      <!-- What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? -->
      <!-- While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc. -->
      <!-- What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? -->
      <!-- At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on? -->
      <!-- For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills. -->
      <p>Communicating over digital platforms without getting anxiety (due to someone traumatic that happened in my past I'd rather not get into) and also communicating my thoughts and getting better at trying to enumerate what it means or why it is that I've got a bad gut feeling about certain architectural decisions when building projects. I'd also like to work on my reflective skills because I think I'm quite good with self-reflection in terms of my own personal <b>state</b>, but perhaps less so my technical <b>processes</b> or other things that I'm yet to think of where I can generalise reflection outside of purely what I currently define to be self-reflection.</p>
      <!-- What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? -->
      <!-- What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations. -->
      <!-- What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp -->
      <p>I expect the bootcamp team to help guide me to teach myself instead of teaching me for me. Basically someone to say "It's going to be okay" and tell me what resources or provide me some ideas for how I can put thing in self to help me manage and organise myself, but actually implementing those things and making them work is up to me. I expect I'll get overwhelmed from time to time, especially if a concept is particularly foreign to me, however if I make sure to rely on communication and continue to allow myself to be a bit more vulnerable and be more forthcoming with how I'm feeling (with a particular focus on when I get that 'drowning' feeling which is a special kinda anxiety I think, it's hopelessness but only because it's wrapped in a fear of judgement)</p>
      <!-- Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way? -->
      <p>Based on my knowledge of Bootcamp, I will probably very much struggle to seek help in a timely way, however I will push myself to practice, practice, practice asking for help like I've been doing as I've been moving and preparing to travel overseas for the first time and I will get better at it. I'll ask in person when people appear to be free if they're free, then ask fellow students, if that fails I'll ask a faciliator if they're free during camp hours and if that fails or if they're all busy I'll throw it into the Discord in an appropriate channel and await a response - if I haven't gotten a response yet and I'm really stuck and can't pivot to something else then I'll escalate the issue into one of the more critical/shouty priority help channels in the Discord.</p>
      <h2>Foundations</h2>
      <p>I want to become a public speaker and an educator. In order to get there, I'll utilise my creativity, passion, enthusiasm and grit to overcome challenges I face, such as finding it incredibly difficult to ask for help and rediscovering who I am after long-term memory issues post-COVID (This includes remembering or at least being able to actually identify what challenges I do face that I just haven't recognised since my issues began). I'd like to get better at talking to people, writing emails with taking several years to draft them, and learning how to deal with things effectively or what to generally do when I'm overstimulated. I'll manage my workload by scheduling in things and trying my best to balance preparing to travel overseas for the first time among study responsabilities - I'm also going to, when things get overwhelming, try to do a worse job. If I get blocked for longer than around 20 minutes, I'll reach out for help in the Discord, either in the #tech-questions channel if it relates to techs, or my homegroup if it relates to reflections or core activities. The facilitation team can help guide me, however they're there to help me figure out how to discover answers myself, not give me the answers outright - whether that be in a technical capacity or one realted to managing stress and other similar things. I'm able to study full-time during work hours, although I do have some things on in the afternoons which can make catch-ups/overflow difficult on a Tuesday.</p>
