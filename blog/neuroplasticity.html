      <p>It's beneficial to understand the principals of neuroplasticity as they help people get out of a fixed mindset. If someone has a fixed mindset, they associate their past, future or present failures with their own personal value instead of seeing them as opportunities to improve themselves.</p>
      <p>As someone dancing with both a recovering brain as well as ADHD, I found <a href="https://podtail.com/podcast/hacking-your-adhd/retrain-your-brain-with-ben-ahrens/">this podcast episode</a> from the <b>Hacking your ADHD</b> podcast both incredibly relatable and insightful.</p>
      <p>To take full advantage of neuroplasticity, you want to adopt a growth mindset. With a growth mindset, your failures are nothing more than lessons and opportunities to improve yourself. Instead of telling yourself "I can't do that", you tell yourself "I can't do that yet". Instead of thinking "I'm not smart enough", you think "I've still go so much to learn!". Having a growth mindset isn't about ignoring challenges, it's about embracing them and letting them help you become the person you strive to be.</p>
      <p>I've relearning a lot of aspects about adopting a growth mindset and reframing things with regards to neuroplasticity, I was more or less practising these things already, however I had nothing to connect it to and I wasn't thinking about it as a way to help me get through tough times.</p>
      <p>I'm planning to double-down on trying to implement my own positive self-talk and tackling any opportunities to reframe a challenging or frustrating situation as an opportunity for myself. I'm also trying to plant the seed for adopting a growth mindset for friends and family that are struggling with things, but I'm being very conscious to do so in a kind, respectful way without being overbearing, as I know through some of my relationships how it can feel when people with good intentions give you advice that feels a little bit too much like they're telling you how to live your life, which can of course have the inverse affect and you end up alienating yourselves from them to a degree when all you wanted to do was help.</p>
