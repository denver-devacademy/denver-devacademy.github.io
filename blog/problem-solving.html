      <h2>Blocked by a Simple Problem</h2>
      <p>While working on my Dev Academy work I got blocked during one of the previous sprints due to a bug in an interactive coding lesson. When I realised my solution to a challenge wasn't registered as being correct, even though it appeared to be, the first thing I did was try to tinker with my code or try a different way of achieving the same effect (making text red using CSS). I wasn't able to get it work after trying for a few minutes, so then I jumped into the dev academy discord and searched for "red text stuck" and almost immediately found someone else with the a very similar issue. Unfortunately it wasn't exactly the same, but it seemed similar enough that I tried using a different browser and ended up overcoming the issue :)</p>
      <h2>Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
      <p>I needed to get flights booked for my travel to NZ but was feeling anxious about it and was worried I'd get distracted - I was also feeling quite socially isolated and really wanted to spend some time with a friend. I had a think about it and tried to think about how I might be able to kill two birds with one stone. So I asked me friend if they had any plans later in the afternoon and if they were able to give me a hand booking my flights because I was extremely overwhelmed, they said yes and they'd love to help and hang for a bit and we got them booked that night! I'm going to try to keep seeking out opportunities to not necessarily "multi-task" perse, but more so try to combine two problems into one more fun solution that ticks multiple boxes, as I practice with this I'm getting better at it. The main challenge at the moment is relearning/understanding the problem space involved with a lot of my challenges and how I can help myself, a lot of things that were once simple for me are confusing with my memory issues and brain fog, but I'm getting through it bit-by-bit, I'm miles ahead of where I was this same time last months, and I'm making good progress and I feel good about myself :)</p>
      <h2>Confidence with Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <p>I think I'm great with pseudocode and experimentation to solve problems, and I tend to be quite good at interpreting error messages, searching online (both search engines and also sites like reddit or niche forums) and using <code></code>console.log</code>s to debug. I've been aware of rubber duck debugging for a while, but I haven't done it much, so it's certainly an area for growth. I have quite a long path ahead of me with regards to asking my peers or coaches for help and I find it very, very challenging because I worry about feeling like I'm wasting other people's time - I've also not go a lot of experiencing asking people for help, which compounds the issue because then it feels into having a complex about inexperience in a given category of social interaction which doesn't tend to come to me naturally as someone on the spectrum. I think I implicitly do process reflection, but I don't think I've ever really done it in an explicit manner, I think - I'm excited to try to give it more of a shot and see how I can apply to it reflecting in an internal sense but also seeing where I can generalize it out to. I think I'm good at 'reflecting' in a sense on other people's processes, but struggle or perhaps just don't even think to try doing it to/for my own processes</p>
