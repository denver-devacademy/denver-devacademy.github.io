        <p>Yesterday and friend and I were in a rush to get a train and I noticed somebody's mobile phone was on the ground outside the train station. Instead of just running past it to get our train I stopped and thought about what we should do so that the person can get their phone back (e.g. where can we leave it, what about weather, how do we make sure they'll be able to find it). I picked it up and unfortunately the screen was cracked to hell anyway, so although the back of the phone was in perfect condition the front screen was totally destroyed. We ended up leaving in the same spot we found it because it was clearly already pretty severely damaged, and if they were going to come back for it for any reason it's probably best we leave it where they'd expect to find it.</p>
        <p>I surround myself with people from the hackerspace and other people that think unconventionally. I'm also pretty involved in the open-source community and the linux scene, which has greatly influenced my opinions on things like right to repair, open-source software and building technology that helps drive innovation and help people instead of focusing on profit. I am a hacker, creator, artist and human :)</p>
        <p>My strengths are attention to detail, grit and empathy. I don't remember how I used to describe myself pre-COVID memory issues, and I don't remember the names of most of the values I'd assign to myself.</p>
        <p>My greatest limitations are a fear of feeling like I'm wasting other peoples' time (especially when the topic is something that only affects me or feels highly opinionated) and I don't know. I have many limitations, but right now not knowing what most of my limitations are due to my memory is probably the greatest. I can't really give concrete prescise examples of what's happened at my work in the past as it's all just foggy for me past March.</p>
        <p>Regarding an example of when I tried working productively with others, but there was resistance or tension, I don't remember. I'm really sorry. I've only worked on my own projects since my post-COVID memory issues, and I've collaborated with people fairly minimally and when I have collaborated it's gone really smoothly. I'm really sorry, I don't know :(</p>
