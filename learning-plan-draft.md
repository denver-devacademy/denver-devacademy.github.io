# Learning Plan

I want to become a public speaker and an educator. In order to get there, I'll utilise my creativity, passion, enthusiasm and grit to overcome challenges I face, such as finding it incredibly difficult to ask for help and rediscovering who I am after long-term memory issues post-COVID (This includes remembering or at least being able to actually identify what challenges I do face that I just haven't recognised since my issues began). I'd like to get better at talking to people, writing emails with taking several years to draft them, and learning how to deal with things effectively or what to generally do when I'm overstimulated. I'll manage my workload by scheduling in things and trying my best to balance preparing to travel overseas for the first time among study responsabilities - I'm also going to, when things get overwhelming, try to do a worse job. If I get blocked for longer than around 20 minutes, I'll reach out for help in the Discord, either in the #tech-questions channel if it relates to techs, or my homegroup if it relates to reflections or core activities. The facilitation team can help guide me, however they're there to help me figure out how to discover answers myself, not give me the answers outright - whether that be in a technical capacity or one realted to managing stress and other similar things. I'm able to study full-time during work hours, although I do have some things on in the afternoons which can make catch-ups/overflow difficult on a Tuesday.

3.  What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
- I don't really know how to categorise them, however being able to clearly communicate what my concerns are and also being able to. I'm not really entirely sure.

4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
  - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    - try my best to and practice reaching out for help.
  - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    - try to ask for help

5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
- On the Discord, as soon as I've been blocked for 20 minutes or more.

6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
- Guidance when asked for, but not explicit.

7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
